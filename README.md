# AoC Day5 Coding Solution
## Description

My solution to Advent of Code's 2022 event for the fifth day.  
The program will give the answer to the second part, however the first part is also included, simply commented out.

## Compiling and Running
Open or cd the terminal into the directory containing the build.gradle file.
Run the following:
```
gradle build   
gradle run
```
gradle run will print out the line that needs to be typed in to execute the program:
```
java -cp build/classes/java/main Runner
```
This will execute the program.
